# üí≥ Credit Score Type Prediction üìä

## üìú Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the credit score of customers based on their financial and transactional data. Accurate prediction of credit scores is essential for financial institutions to assess creditworthiness, manage risks, and make informed lending decisions.

## üîß Key Techniques

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracting valuable features from the raw data.
- **Modeling**: Various classification models were applied, including Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, and Gradient Boosting.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: The models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## üìà Results and Observations

After applying several classification models, the following results were observed:

| **Model**                     | **Accuracy Score** |
|-------------------------------|--------------------|
| **Random Forest Classifier**   | **0.81575**        |
| **KNeighbors Classifier**      | **0.77585**        |
| **Decision Tree Classifier**   | **0.77115**        |
| **Gradient Boosting Classifier**| **0.70880**        |
| **Bernoulli NB**               | **0.62250**        |
| **Gaussian NB**                | **0.61720**        |
| **Logistic Regression**        | **0.54175**        |

- **Random Forest Classifier** performed the best with an accuracy of **81.57%**. Its classification report revealed:
  - **Good** credit scores: 78% precision and 78% recall.
  - **Poor** credit scores: 80% precision and 84% recall.
  - **Standard** credit scores: 84% precision and 82% recall.
  - Weighted average F1-score: **82%**.

- When a deep learning approach was used, accuracy dropped significantly to **53%**, which was lower than even simpler models like Logistic Regression.

Thus, traditional machine learning models like Random Forest outperformed deep learning methods for this dataset.
